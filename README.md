King in the North is a text adventure game based on the campaign of Robb Stark, whom you will play as the protagonist, in the war of five kings period in Game of Throne. We try to replicate the essential characters in this period and create the major events: battle at the Twins, battle at the Riverrun, Red Wedding, the sack of Winterfell by Greyjoyâ€¦ etc.. As a military leader, you mainly need to interact and use your army to solve the puzzles to advance to the next stage, and be aware not to piss off both Bolton and Frey so that Red Wedding will take place. The final battle with Theon Greyjoy will also be a deadly one, after which you can proclaim to be the true King in the North!
